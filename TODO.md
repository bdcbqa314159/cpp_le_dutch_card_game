# TO DO list

- Finish the README with the rules of the game in french and english
- First aim is to create a single player game with only the rules during the player's turn and against two bots.
- Create the multiplayer (1vs1 and 2 bots) with the same rules as previously.
- Implement the remaining rules with multi processing queues.
- Implemnt the GUI for all this.

Note: within step 2 we already need to implement all the little components to make the essential building blocks for the game.

Note bis: we will need to use google test framework for the unit tests.
